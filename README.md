# Odin Recipes

This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum. It involves creating a simple recipe website to practice HTML and CSS skills. By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated the ability to:

- Structure web pages using HTML
- Style web pages using CSS
- Organize a project with multiple pages and link them together
